Objective

Implement K-Means clustering to group similar data points and evaluate the quality of clustering.

Dataset

Name: Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset

Source: Kaggle Link

Description: Contains customer details such as Age, Gender, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

Tools Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy – Data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – K-Means clustering & evaluation

Steps Followed

Imported dataset into Google Colab.

Checked dataset structure and cleaned data.

Selected features for clustering.

Used Elbow Method to find best K value.

Applied K-Means algorithm to create clusters.

Visualized clusters and centroids.

Measured performance using Silhouette Score.

Results

Optimal K: Determined using Elbow Method.

Clusters: Created groups of customers with similar spending patterns.

Silhouette Score: Used to verify cluster quality.
